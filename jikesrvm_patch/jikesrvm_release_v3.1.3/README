To update JikesRVM with the JavaTryCatchWS functionality, do the following:

1) Download Jikes RVM 3.1.3 release:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/jikesrvm/files/jikesrvm/3.1.3/

2) 
cd jikesrvm-3.1.3
patch -p1 <./JavaTryCatchWS.patch

3) Copy the files "../common/WS.java", "StackFrameCopier.java" and "../common/ParallelForWS.java"
inside the directory: "rvm/src/org/jikesrvm/scheduler".

4) Now you can use the buildit to build the rvm:
./bin/buildit localhost production
