To update JikesRVM with the JavaTryCatchWS functionality, do the following:


==========================================================================
1st September 2015: Latest patch based on hg version 11181
==========================================================================
1) Clone Jikes RVM from repository:
hg clone  http://hg.code.sourceforge.net/p/jikesrvm/code jikesrvm

2) 
cd jikesrvm
hg update -r 11181
patch -p1 <./JavaTryCatchWS_hg11181.patch

3) Copy the files "../common/WS.java", "StackFrameCopier.java" and "../common/ParallelForWS.java"
